DATA DESCRIPTION
Worm Gen	
An = ancestor or generation 0	
Coevo = populations that have undergone coevolution treatment (30 gens for COW and COF and 10 generations for COX)	
	
Mating type	
COX = obligate selfing populations	
COW = wildtype populations	
COF = obligate outcrossing populations	
	
	
Replication pop	
Each mating type contained 5 independently mutated replicate populations.	
COX 1 & 2 went extinct before preservation at generation 10, and are therefore not represented.	
	
Serratia	
the strain of Serratia to which the C. elegans populations was exposed	
A = the ancestral strain Sm2170	
C = the non-coevolving strain	
Co = the strain that coevolved with that specific C. elegans population	
	
	
Rep	
an individual 24-hour mortality trial	
	
# dead	
the number of dead C. elegans counted after 24 hours of exposures to the Serratia. A total of 200 C. elegans were exposed in each trial.	
	
Mortality Rate	
equals # dead / 200 (the total number of C. elegans exposed)	


TASK
Compute mean mortality rate for the cases a-r in Figure 2.
